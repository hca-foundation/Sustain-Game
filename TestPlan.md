Authored by: Summer Perkey and Ankaj Goel

## INTRODUCTION

- This application is used to create quizzes that can be administered at events or on the internet.
- There is a backend admin site as well as a user application for game play, which also includes a leaderboard.
- This application will be a web based application that can be used on desktop or mobile web browsers. This is not a freestanding mobile application.
- This application will be used by both adults and children. Demographics will be captured for users over 18 years old. Only Username will be required for those under 18 years old.

### TOOLS

- Developers will be committing work to the team GitHub repository. Once pull requests are completed these will be ready for QA testing.
- Backend API testing will be completed using PostMan calls and Frontend UI will be available via direct URLs for testing.

### TIMESCALE

Full development and testing to be completed within the timeframe of the Hack for the Community event. Due to time constraints the following items may not be fully tested:

- Full Application functionality on physical mobile device
- Full Application functionality on desktop browser

### OUT OF SCOPE

Mobile Application

### ASSUMPTIONS

- All users have internet access
- All users have web browsers
- The majority of users will be on mobile devices
- All users will be able to read and comprehend the English language
- All users will receive questions from the event set regardless of age 
- Only users of the age of 18 will be required to complete registration

### RISKS

- Given the responsive nature of web page, different screen sizes and resolutions may have UI look distorted. QA team will try to cover as many resolutions as possible in given time limit.
- Limited testing of desktop version on all browsers and/or physical devices
- Due to time limit, there might be few open bugs which might get deferred and would need to be addressed by support team (post H4TC)
